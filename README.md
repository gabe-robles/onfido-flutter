## Overview

The Onfido Flutter SDK provides a drop-in set of screens and tools for Flutter applications to capture identity documents and selfie photos and videos for the purpose of identity verification.

It offers a number of benefits to help you create the best identity verification experience for your customers:

-   Carefully designed UI to guide your customers through the photo and video capture process
-   Modular design to help you seamlessly integrate the photo and video capture process into your application flow
-   Advanced image quality detection technology to ensure the quality of the captured images meets the requirement of the Onfido identity verification process, guaranteeing the best success rate
-   Direct image upload to the Onfido service, to simplify integration


> ‚ÑπÔ∏è 
> 
> If you are integrating using Onfido Studio please see our [Studio integration guide](ONFIDO_STUDIO.md)

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: The SDK is only responsible for capturing and uploading photos and videos. You still need to access the [Onfido API](https://documentation.onfido.com/) to manage applicants and perform checks.

## Getting started

* Dart 2.12 or higher
* Flutter 1.20 or higher
* Supports iOS 11+
* Supports Android API level 21+
* Supports iPads and tablets

### 1. Obtain an API token

In order to start integrating, you'll need an [API token](https://documentation.onfido.com/#api-tokens).

You can use our [sandbox](https://documentation.onfido.com/#sandbox-testing) environment to test your integration. To use the sandbox, you'll need to generate a sandbox API token in your [Onfido Dashboard](https://onfido.com/dashboard/api/tokens).

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: You must never use API tokens in the frontend of your application or malicious users could discover them in your source code. You should only use them on your server.

#### 1.1 Regions

Onfido offers region-specific environments. Refer to the [Regions](https://documentation.onfido.com/#regions) section in our API documentation for token format and API base URL information.

### 2. Create an applicant

To create an applicant from your backend server, make a request to the ['create applicant' endpoint](https://documentation.onfido.com/#create-applicant), using a valid API token.

**Note**: Different report types have different minimum requirements for applicant data. For a Document or Facial Similarity report the minimum applicant details required are `first_name` and `last_name`.

```shell
$ curl https://api.onfido.com/v3/applicants \
    -H 'Authorization: Token token=<YOUR_API_TOKEN>' \
    -d 'first_name=John' \
    -d 'last_name=Smith'
```

The JSON response will return an `id` field containing a UUID that identifies the applicant. Once you pass the applicant ID to the SDK, documents and live photos and videos uploaded by that instance of the SDK will be associated with that applicant.

### 3. Configure the SDK with token

You'll need to generate and include an SDK token every time you initialize the SDK.

To generate an SDK token, make a request to the ['generate SDK token' endpoint](https://documentation.onfido.com/#generate-web-sdk-token).

```shell
$ curl https://api.onfido.com/v3/sdk_token \
  -H 'Authorization: Token token=<YOUR_API_TOKEN>' \
  -F 'applicant_id=<APPLICANT_ID>' \
  -F 'application_id=<YOUR_APPLICATION_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER>'
```

| Parameter           |  Notes   |
| ------------ | --- |
| `applicant_id` | **required** <br /> Specifies the applicant for the SDK instance. |
| `application_id` | **required** <br /> The application ID (for iOS "application bundle ID") that was set up during development. For iOS, this is usually in the form `com.your-company.app-name`. Make sure to use a valid `application_id` or you'll receive a 401 error. |

‚ö†Ô∏è SDK tokens expire after 90 minutes.

### 4. Add the SDK dependency
```shell
flutter pub add onfido_sdk
```

### 5. Update your iOS Configuration files

Change `ios/Podfile` to use version 11:
```
platform :ios, '11.0'
```

The SDK uses the device camera. You're required to have the following keys in your application's `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file:
*  `NSCameraUsageDescription`
*  `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription`

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>Required for document and facial capture</string>
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>Required for video capture</string>
```
**Note**: All keys will be required for app submission.

## Usage

### 1. Creating the SDK configuration
Once you have an added the SDK as a dependency, and you have a SDK token, you can configure the SDK:

```dart
final Onfido onfido = Onfido(
  sdkToken: apiToken,
  iosLocalizationFileName: "onfido_ios_localisation"
);
```

#### 1.1 Parameter details

* **`sdkToken`**: Required.  This is the JWT sdk token obtained by making a call to the SDK token API.  See section [Configuring SDK with Tokens](#3-configure-the-sdk-with-token).
* **`iosLocalizationFileName`**: Optional. This is the file name for configuring the localisation for iOS only. See section [Language Customisation](#language-customisation) for the details.

### 2. Start the flow
```dart
startOnfido() async {
  try {
    final response = await onfido.start(
      flowSteps: FlowSteps(
        proofOfAddress: true,
        welcome: true,
        documentCapture: DocumentCapture(),
        faceCapture: FaceCaptureType.photo,
      ),
    );
    ... handle response
  } catch (error) {
    ... handle error
  }
}
```

#### 2.1 Parameter details

* **`flowSteps`**: Required. This object is used to toggle individual screens on and off and set configurations inside the screens. 
  * **`FlowSteps.welcome`**: Optional. This toggles the welcome screen on or off. If omitted, this screen does not appear in the flow.

  * **`FlowSteps.proofOfAddress`**: Optional. In the Proof of Address step, a user picks the issuing country and type of document that proves their address before capturing the document with their phone camera or uploading it.

  * **`FlowSteps.documentCapture`**: Optional. In the Document step, a user can pick the type of document to capture and its issuing country before capturing it with their phone camera. Document selection and country selection are both optional screens. These screens will only show to the end user if specific options are not configured to the SDK.
    * **`DocumentCapture.documentType`**: Required if countryCode is specified. Valid values in `document_type.dart`.
    * **`DocumentCapture.countryCode`**: Required if documentType is specified. Valid values in `country_code.dart`.

  * **`FlowSteps.faceCapture`**: Optional. In the Face step, a user can use the front camera to capture either a live photo of their face, or a live video. Valid values in `face_capture_type.dart`.
  * **`FlowSteps.enableNFC`**: Optional.  This toggles the ePassport NFC extraction feature. If omitted, this feature is not enabled in the flow. There is also application configuration changes needed to use this feature. To do that please follow [Onfido Developer Hub](#https://developers.onfido.com/guide/document-report-nfc#enable-nfc-in-the-onfido-sdks)

### 3. Handling responses

#### Success handling
When the user has reached the end of the flow, you will receive the response with `[OnfidoResult]` and you can now [create a check]() on your backend server.

`[OnfidoResult]` is a list with multiple results. The results are different objects, each with its own associated value (also known as payload). This object, `OnfidoResult`, can have the following values:

```dart
OnfidoResult(
  document: DocumentResult(
    front: DocumentSideResult(id: "id"),
    typeSelected: "passport",
    countrySelected: null,
  ),
  face: FaceResult(
    id: "id",
    variant: FaceCaptureType.video,
  ),
  proofOfAddress: ProofOfAddressResult(
    id: "id",
    type: "bank_building_society_statement",
    issuingCountry: "BRA",
  ),
);
```

#### Error handling
You will receive a `PlatformException` if something goes wrong and the SDK will reject the promise falling into the catch block. The failure can be triggered during the initialisation, user leaving the SDK flow without completing it and run time exceptions.

| Error Code | Notes |
| ----- | ------ |
| `exit` | When the user has left the SDK flow without completing. |
| `error` | When something happens in run time, e.g. camera permission denied by the user. |
| `configuration` | When something happens before initializing the SDK, may be caused by invalid configuration. |


## Language Customisation

The SDK supports and maintains the following 7 languages:

 - English (en) üá¨üáß
 - Spanish (es) üá™üá∏
 - French (fr) üá´üá∑
 - German (de) üá©üá™
 - Italian (it) üáÆüáπ
 - Portuguese (pt) üáµüáπ
 - Dutch (nl) üá≥üá±

However, you can add your own translations.

### Android
By default, custom localisation is enabled on Android. There is no configuration needed on Flutter SDK to enable it.
You could also provide custom translation for a locale that we don‚Äôt currently support, by having an additional XML strings file inside your resources folder for the desired locale. See [Localisation section of Android SDK repo](https://github.com/onfido/onfido-android-sdk#4-localisation) for the details.

### iOS
You can also provide a custom translation for a locale that Onfido doesn't currently support.
There is a simple configuration needed on the Flutter SDK to enable custom localisation.

1. Add this statement to your configuration object.
```dart
final Onfido onfido = Onfido(
  ...
  iosLocalizationFileName: '<Your .strings file name in iOS app bundle>'
);
```
2. Navigate to the iOS folder ```cd ios```, and open your XCode workspace.
3. Follow the instructions for [iOS Localisation](https://medium.com/lean-localization/ios-localization-tutorial-938231f9f881) to add a new custom language or override existing translations.
4. You can find the keys that need to be translated in the [iOS SDK repo](https://github.com/onfido/onfido-ios-sdk/blob/master/localization/Localizable_EN.strings).


## UI Customisation
The SDK supports the customisation of colors and fonts used in the SDK flow.

### Android
There is no configuration needed on Flutter SDK to enable it. 
See [UI Customisation section on Android SDK](https://github.com/onfido/onfido-android-sdk#ui-customization) for more details.

### iOS
You can use the `IOSAppearance` object to customise the iOS application.

For example: 
```dart
final Onfido onfido = Onfido(
  iosAppearance: IOSAppearance(
      fontBold: "<Font-Name>",
      supportDarkMode: false,
      fontRegular: "<Font-Name>",
      secondaryTitleColor: Colors.yourColor,
      primaryColor: Colors.yourColor,
      buttonCornerRadius: 10,
      primaryTitleColor: Colors.yourColor,
      bubbleErrorBackgroundColor: Colors.yourColor,
      primaryBackgroundPressedColor: Colors.yourColor,
      secondaryBackgroundPressedColor: Colors.yourColor),
);
```

## Error handling

The `Error` object returned as part of `PlatformException` which translate the errors from native side to Dart. You can identify the type of the error from the error message

```dart
    // This happens if the user denies permission to the SDK during the flow
    PlatformException(error, The operation couldn‚Äôt be completed. (Onfido.OnfidoFlowError error 2.), cameraPermission, null)
    
    // This happens when the SDK tries to save capture to disk, maybe due to a lack of space
    PlatformException(error, The operation couldn‚Äôt be completed. (Onfido.OnfidoFlowError error 2.), failedToWriteToDisk, null)

    // This happens when the user denies permission for microphone usage by the app during the flow
    PlatformException(error, The operation couldn‚Äôt be completed. (Onfido.OnfidoFlowError error 2.), microphonePermission, null)

    // This happens when the SDK receives an error from an API call see [https://documentation.onfido.com/#errors](https://documentation.onfido.com/#errors) for more information
    PlatformException(error, The operation couldn‚Äôt be completed. (Onfido.OnfidoFlowError error 2.), upload, null)

    // This happens when an unexpected error occurs. Please contact [ios-sdk@onfido.com](mailto:ios-sdk@onfido.com?Subject=ISSUE%3A) when this happens
    PlatformException(error, The operation couldn‚Äôt be completed. (Onfido.OnfidoFlowError error 2.), exception, null)

    // This happens when you are using an older version of the iOS SDK and trying to access a new functionality from workflow. You can fix this by updating the SDK
    PlatformException(error, The operation couldn‚Äôt be completed. (Onfido.OnfidoFlowError error 2.), versionInsufficient, null)

    // The flow was exited prematurely by the user. The reason can be `.userExit` or `.consentDenied`
    PlatformException(exit, "User canceled the flow", null, null)
```
